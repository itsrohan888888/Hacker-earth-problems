# first we use cpunter function fom collections module
# we make list named singers and use map which includes a bracket, inside bracket before comma we use the function and after comma we use the way to
# enter values (in this case int is the function and input is how we enter the numbers)
# then we make a dict using Counter function out of singers list
# Now we the singer which is streamed most which we make using max function of the values of count 
# Now we have made an variable name cnt to keep count of the most streamed singers( in case there are more than one singer with same amount of stream count)
# we use for loop which will go through list singers 
# here is how it works:
# let there be 5 singers arijit:200 mika:40 jubin:150 sonu:180 ed:200
# here maximum frequency frequency=200
# here for will first see arjit it has frquency of 200 which is equal to max_frequency thus 1 will be added to cnt
# now it will proceed to mika which does not have frequency equal to 200, thus it will ignore it and cnt will remain 1
# now sam happens with jubin and sonu
# now loop has reached ed which also have the frequency of streams equal to max_frequency ie. 200 so it will add 1 to cnt making it 2
# final result: it prints 2 which is the most streamed singers also the favourite singers
